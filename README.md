# Web-Map-application

In this project, we can learn to create web maps using python and folium. A web map is an interactive display of geographic information that you can use to tell stories and answer questions.
Folium uses the data munging(data wrangling) capabilities of python and the mapping capabilities of Leaflet.js library.
